# - Dummy module containing information about these modules for the HELP file
# This file documents a snapshot of the cmake-modules available from
# http://github.com/rpavlik/cmake-modules/
# The latest version of these modules can always be found there.
# Additionally, you can find instructions on how to integrate these modules
# into your own project either in the README.markdown file in this directory,
# or on the GitHub page listed above (scroll to the bottom to see the README
# rendered attractively).
#
# In short: Modules of the form "FindSomeName.cmake" are considered to be
# "find modules", and are intended to be used indirectly by calling find_package,
# not by calling include.  Thus, you'll want to do something like:
#  find_package(SomeName)
# They define a number of variables allowing you to use whatever software
# they search for, such as include directories and libraries. A few also
# define some functions for your use.
#
# All other modules provide functionality, either immediately upon including
# them, or by defining functions that perform some task of varying utility
# that you can use any time after including them. Note that if a module
# has the filename, for example, cmake/BoostTestTargets.cmake, you only
# need to call:
#  include(BoostTestTargets)
#
# For more information, see the documentation for individual modules, the 
# cmake-modules github page, and/or the upstream CMake documentation at
# http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html
