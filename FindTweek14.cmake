# - try to find Tweek 1.4 library
# Requires VPR 2.2 (thus FindVPR22.cmake)
# Optionally uses Flagpoll and FindFlagpoll.cmake
#
# This library is a part of VR Juggler 3.0 - you probably want to use
# find_package(VRJuggler30) instead, for an easy interface to this and
# related scripts.  See FindVRJuggler30.cmake for more information.
#
#  TWEEK14_LIBRARY_DIR, library search path
#  TWEEK14_INCLUDE_DIR, include search path
#  TWEEK14_LIBRARY, the library to link against
#  TWEEK14_FOUND, If false, do not try to use this library.
#
# Plural versions refer to this library and its dependencies, and
# are recommended to be used instead, unless you have a good reason.
#
# Useful configuration variables you might want to add to your cache:
#  TWEEK14_ROOT_DIR - A directory prefix to search
#                     (a path that contains include/ as a subdirectory)
#
# This script will use Flagpoll, if found, to provide hints to the location
# of this library, but does not use the compiler flags returned by Flagpoll
# directly.
#
# The VJ_BASE_DIR environment variable is also searched (preferentially)
# when searching for this component, so most sane build environments should
# "just work."  Note that you need to manually re-run CMake if you change
# this environment variable, because it cannot auto-detect this change
# and trigger an automatic re-run.
