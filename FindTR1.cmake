# - Try to find C++ TR1 headers and libraries
# Once done, this will define
#
#  TR1_USE_FILE, which you may "include" in your CMake file to be able
#   to use TR1 features transparently
#  TR1_INCLUDE_DIRS, any directories needed to access TR1 headers
#  TR1_LIBRARY_DIRS, any directories needed to access (auto-link) TR1 libraries
#  TR1_FOUND, If false, do not try to use TR1 features.
#
# If TR1 features are not built-in, we will try to use Boost to
# substitute for them.
